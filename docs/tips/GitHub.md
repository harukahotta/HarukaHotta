Git(GitHub)

## Terms

### origin

"origin" is an alias for the remote repository.

### HEAD

"HEAD" can always be used to refer to the current branch.

### git fork vs git clone

Forking is done on the GitHub Account while Cloning is done using Git. When you fork a repository, you create a copy of the original repository (upstream repository) but the repository remains on your GitHub account. Whereas, when you clone a repository, the repository is copied on to your local machine with the help of Git.
